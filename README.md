## NAME

wax - webify your CLI

## SYNOPSIS

    wax [OPTIONS] program [OPTIONS] ...

## DESCRIPTION

`wax` is a command-line program which runs other command-line programs and converts their URL
arguments to file paths. By default, the files are cleaned up after the command has exited.

As well as adding transparent support for remote resources to commands that don't support them
natively, `wax` can be used to:

- add support for HTTPS (and any other protocols supported by [LWP](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP)) to programs that only support HTTP
- add a mirroring layer to network requests (remote resources are only fetched if they have been updated)
- add a caching layer to network requests (remote resources are only fetched once)

For more details, see the `wax` [manpage](bin/wax.pod).
